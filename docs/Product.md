**TLDR:**
* This document describes the `GfX-Engine` project, its vision, and its goals.
* `GfX-Engine` is a 2D pixel art game engine built in Rust.
*   The engine is being developed alongside a complete demo game, "Super Cat Bros - Episode 1 - The Pirate Gold Adventure."

## Project Vision

To create a fun, classic-style 2D platformer while simultaneously building a reusable, data-driven, and high-fidelity game engine (`Gfx-Engine`).

## Unique Selling Points (Engine)

*   **Deterministic Replay System:** Built-in recording and playback of gameplay sessions.
*   **Runtime Audio Sync:** Automatic beat detection for rhythm-based mechanics.
*   **Observability First:** Real-time hierarchical profiling and hotspot analysis.
*   **1:1 Pixel Workflow:** Logic and physics operate in a high-resolution 1:1 space with data-driven upscaling.


## Overview

`GfX-Engine` is a 2D pixel art game engine built with Rust. The project's primary goal is to create a reusable and modular engine, with the development of a "Super Cat Bros" demo game to showcase its capabilities.

The project is well-defined with a clear vision and goals, and is supported by thorough documentation that is updated as the project evolves.
