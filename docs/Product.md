**TLDR:**
* This document describes the `GfX-Engine` project, its vision, and its goals.
* `GfX-Engine` is a 2D pixel art game engine built in Rust.
* The engine is being developed alongside a complete demo game, "Super Cat Bros."

## Project Vision

To create a fun, classic-style 2D platformer ("Super Cat Bros") while simultaneously building a reusable, data-driven, and performant game engine (`Gfx-Engine`) for the Rust community to learn from and build upon.

## Overview

`GfX-Engine` is a 2D pixel art game engine built with Rust. The project's primary goal is to create a reusable and modular engine, with the development of a "Super Cat Bros" demo game to showcase its capabilities.

The project is well-defined with a clear vision and goals, and is supported by thorough documentation that is updated as the project evolves.
